<h1>Simplified blockchain implementation</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This program simulates a simplified version of a blockchain. It generates a set amount of users and transactions between those users, then mines blocks by picking a certain amount of transactions from the generated list and using a hashing function I made with the help of Claude AI to mine it and add it to the blockchain.</p>
<h2>UTXO model</h2>
<p>This implementation uses the UTXO model, so in all the transactions, payment is done through the creation and destruction of UTXOs. When the transaction is first generated, the UTXOs aren't added or deducted from users' wallets yet - they're only flagged as inputs or generated as outputs. They are only added to users' wallets or destroyed when the transaction is included in a block and added to the blockchain. Each user has 50 UTXOs that are worth between 50 and 500 to begin with. This number was initially diffent (10 UTXOs worth between 100 and 1000), but because all the transactions are generated at once and users only get the UTXOs they receive in transactions after all those transactions are generated and put into blocks, users were running out of UTXO before all the transactions were generated, so I had to give them more.</p>
<p>Each UTXO has an ID, which is generated by hashing its owner's name and public key, along with its value and salt, and a value. It also has an attribute 'used', which "reserves" the UTXO for a transaction, so it is not used in other transactions after already being used in one, along with a transaction ID, which helps determine which transaction it was used in (helpful for UTXO destruction algorithm afterwards). It also has a change flag to determine if this UTXO was given to a user as change in a previous transaction, but this is purely to simplify writing transaction logs and does not affect the calculations whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Step-by-step overview</h2>
<h3>Generating users</h3>
<p>The program generates 1 000 users, each of them have a username ("User_" and their number) and a public key, which is made by hashing their username, combined with a randomly generated salt. Then each of them gets 50 UTXOs with random values between 50 and 500 to spend in the transactions.</p>
<h3>Generating transactions</h3>
<p>The program then generates 10 000 transactions - it randomly picks two users from the list, checks that they are not the same person and that the sender has money to spend. A random amount to transfer is then randomly generated (but it is ensured that this amount is not larger than the sender's balance. In each transaction, the program goes over the UTXOs that the sender has, flags them as used in this transaction and then creates an equivalent UTXO in the transaction output list (but doesn't append it to the receiver yet). This goes on until it processes an UTXO that has the same value as the amount left to pay, at which point it ends the transaction, or has a value that is greater than the amount left to pay, which would cause it to generate two outputs - one for the receiver and one for the sender as change, before also ending the transaction. </p>
<h3>Mining blocks</h3>
<p>When all the transactions are generated, the mining process can begin. The list of transactions is randomly shuffled and a number of them, determined by the block size variable, are chosen to be included in the next block. All those transactions are then moved to a separate list, their IDs are hashed (currently it's just hashed as one big string of all IDs, but a Merkle Root Hash will be implemented in the next version) and the hash of the last block in the blockchain is retrieved (if the chain is empty, the hash is simply 0000...0). These things are then passed into the mining function, where all the block header information is hashed with a nonce that is incremented each loop, until it finds a hash that starts with the set difficulty count of zeroes (3 in this version).</p>
<h3>Adding to the blockchain</h3>
<p>Once a new block is mined, it is added to the blockchain, and all the UTXOs that were used or created in the transactions of the block are finalized - used UTXOs are removed from the users' wallets, and new UTXOs are added.</p>
